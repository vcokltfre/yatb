## Yet another template bot

This is a template for creating nice, advanced bots which don't suck. Hopefully.

## Setup

To set up the bot you will need poetry installed, which can be done using:

Windows: `pip install poetry` or `py -3 -m pip install poetry`
*nix: `pip3 install poetry`

Next, simply run `poetry install`

Done. Now you can copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the correct values.
